## What is a transformer block?

In this section you will build the `Block` class that combines all previous components into a complete transformer block. This is the fundamental repeating unit that makes up GPT-2.

Each block has two sub-layers:
1. Multi-head attention (with layer norm and residual)
2. Feed-forward MLP (with layer norm and residual)

The pattern for each sub-layer:
```
x = x + sublayer(layer_norm(x))
```

GPT-2 stacks 12 identical transformer blocks (for the base model). Each block independently processes the sequence, gradually refining the representations. Early blocks might capture low-level patterns like word associations, while later blocks capture more abstract relationships and long-range dependencies.

## Why this architecture?

**1. Pre-norm Stability**: The pre-norm pattern (normalize before sublayer) is more stable than post-norm (normalize after sublayer + residual). In pre-norm, layer normalization sees the full range of activations before they're processed, preventing extreme values from destabilizing training. This is crucial for training deep networks with 12+ layers. Research shows pre-norm allows training deeper transformers without careful initialization or learning rate warmup.

**2. Attention + MLP Complementarity**: Attention and MLP serve different purposes. Attention performs context-dependent mixing—it routes information between positions based on learned relevance patterns. The MLP processes each position independently with the same weights, performing context-independent transformations. Together, they provide both positional mixing (attention) and per-position computation (MLP). This combination is essential for the model's expressiveness.

**3. Residual Paths Preserve Information**: With two residual connections per block and 12 blocks, there are 24 addition operations in the forward pass. This creates exponentially many paths through the network (2^24 possible combinations of which sublayers to traverse). During training, gradients can flow directly through these skip connections, enabling efficient learning in very deep networks. The residual paths ensure that information from early layers (like positional embeddings) can directly influence later layers.

**4. Modular Composition**: Each transformer block is identical in structure, differing only in learned parameters. This modularity simplifies implementation, enables easy scaling (just change the number of blocks), and allows interesting properties like progressive training (training shallow networks then adding blocks) or block-wise analysis (measuring each block's contribution).

### Key concepts

**Pre-norm Architecture**:
- Pattern: `output = input + sublayer(layer_norm(input))`
- Normalization happens first, before attention or MLP
- More stable than post-norm for deep networks
- Used in GPT-2, GPT-3, and most modern transformers

**Two Sub-layers**:
- **Attention sub-layer**: Multi-head self-attention from Step 09
- **MLP sub-layer**: Position-wise feed-forward from Step 04
- Each has its own layer norm and residual connection
- Process sequentially: attention first, then MLP

**Layer Dimensions**:
- `hidden_size = n_embd = 768` (embedding dimension)
- `inner_dim = 4 * hidden_size = 3072` (MLP inner dimension)
- `layer_norm_epsilon = 1e-5` (numerical stability)
- All sublayers maintain the 768-dimensional representation

**Information Flow**:
- Input: `[batch, seq_length, n_embd]`
- After attention block: same shape (residual preserves dimensions)
- After MLP block: same shape (residual preserves dimensions)
- Output: `[batch, seq_length, n_embd]`
- Dimension preservation allows stacking arbitrary numbers of blocks

**HuggingFace Naming**:
- `ln_1`: First layer norm (before attention)
- `attn`: Multi-head attention
- `ln_2`: Second layer norm (before MLP)
- `mlp`: Feed-forward network
- Matches original GPT-2 implementation for weight loading

### Implementation tasks (`step_11.py`)

1. **Import Required Modules** (Lines 13-18):
   - Import `Module` from `max.nn.module_v3`
   - Import `GPT2Config` from `solutions.solution_01`
   - Import `GPT2MLP` from `solutions.solution_04`
   - Import `GPT2MultiHeadAttention` from `solutions.solution_09`
   - Import `LayerNorm` from `solutions.solution_10`

2. **Create Sub-layers** (Lines 40-53):
   - Create `ln_1`: `LayerNorm(hidden_size, eps=config.layer_norm_epsilon)`
   - Create `attn`: `GPT2MultiHeadAttention(config)`
   - Create `ln_2`: `LayerNorm(hidden_size, eps=config.layer_norm_epsilon)`
   - Create `mlp`: `GPT2MLP(inner_dim, config)`

3. **Implement Attention Block** (Lines 67-71):
   - Store residual: `residual = hidden_states`
   - Normalize: `hidden_states = self.ln_1(hidden_states)`
   - Apply attention: `attn_output = self.attn(hidden_states)`
   - Add residual: `hidden_states = attn_output + residual`

4. **Implement MLP Block** (Lines 74-78):
   - Store residual: `residual = hidden_states`
   - Normalize: `hidden_states = self.ln_2(hidden_states)`
   - Apply MLP: `feed_forward_hidden_states = self.mlp(hidden_states)`
   - Add residual: `hidden_states = residual + feed_forward_hidden_states`

5. **Return Output** (Line 81):
   - Return the final `hidden_states`

**Implementation**:

```python
{{#include ../../steps/step_11.py}}
```
